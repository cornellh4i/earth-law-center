### Using the Google Sheets
The Google Sheets allows you to edit the type of questions and fields that users can see on the Question & Answer component. Here are the columns:

**Field Name**: The name of the field corresponding to the placeholder text inside a template doc. For example, if the template doc contains the phrase `[INSERT NAME OF LOCAL ECOSYSTEM(S)]`, then the field name would be `Name of Local Ecosystem(s)`

**Question**: The question to ask the user for a given field. For example, for the `Name of Local Ecosystem(s)` field, the question could be `What is the name of the local ecosystem?`

**Input Type**: The input type of the question. There exist 3 valid input types:
- `short text input`: text input under 100 characters
- `long text input`: longer text input
- `states dropdown select`: dropdown of all 50 US states
