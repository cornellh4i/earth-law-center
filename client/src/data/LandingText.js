const HeaderDescription = "Earth Legislator is a web portal with ecocentric (or “Earth-centered”) legal models that legislators, activists, and others can easily customize and download—much like the popular websites “Rocket Lawyer” or “LegalZoom” but for the planet. It also features customizable letter templates, toolkits, and other resources, making it easier for anyone to help ecocentric legal movements flourish across the globe. These legal movements aim to address shortcomings of the current legal system, which legalizes the destruction of nature, so that we achieve a future in which humans and Nature flourish together."
